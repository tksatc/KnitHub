            Years of using (and losing) hand-written lists of yarn requirements, spreadsheet inventories,
            and adding a fourth bedroom to house a yarn stash led to Knit Hub.  You caught us, the
            bedroom addition was a wee bit of an exageration, but you understand what we mean.  Our
            combined experiences led us to trying to find a solution to this common problem.<br /><br />

            We are passionate about the fiber arts and supporting fellow artisans.
